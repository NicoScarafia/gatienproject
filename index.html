      <h3> <em>Why</em> <br>you should hire an agent who has partnered with <br> a luxury real estate marketing company.
      </h3>

      <div class="intro-content">
        <p>One of the biggest perks of working with a real estate agent is their ability to market your property to the
          right target audience. A professional agent with the right experience will be able to identify who will be
          interested in your property and implement effective strategies to reach them via their website, paid
          advertising, social media, and other means. When you work with an agent who has partnered with Luxury
          Presence, you benefit from the many different types of marketing capabilities the company offers.</p>

            time online, and how they make their buying decisions.</p>
          <p> Agents who use luxury real estate marketing services are able to <em>identify your niche market</em>, then
            create paid ads on Facebook, Google, Instagram, and YouTube that reach those interested in your property.
            These paid ad campaigns are highly customized and targeted, ensuring you are not spending money marketing to
            those who are not in the market for a property such as yours.</p>

      <h4 class="expert-content-title">Expert Content Production</h4>

      <p class="expert-content-subtitle">Content is one of the most powerful resources a real estate agent has to promote your
        property. <em>Being able to create high-quality content such as video and copywriting is an essential tool</em>
        that elevates the agents who use luxury real estate marketing services above their competitors.</p>

      <div class="expert-content-image">
        <img src="assets/img/miami/content-production.jpg" alt="">
      </div>

      <div class="expert-content-text">
        <p>According to a recent survey, 85 percent of buyers and sellers want to work with an agent who uses video —
          and for good reason. An agent who uses video is able to connect with potential buyers on a deeper level and
          build trust and rapport. When they use video to market your property, they are showing viewers what it would
          really be like to walk through and live in your home — something that is much more difficult to do with a
          written description. However, written descriptions — or copywriting — is also important. Your property needs
          to be described in appealing and vibrant terms on the listing and on any additional marketing that is created
          to sell it. </p>

        <p class="second-paragraph">Those agents who work with Luxury Presence get access to experienced real estate
          copywriters who create blogs, website copy, and content marketing pieces that make your property attractive to
          potential buyers.</p>

        <div class="text-content">
          <p>Recent research has shown that 44% of home buyers found the home they purcased on the internet. Many of
            them simply googled the search terms that they wanted in a new home and started their search that way. </p>
          <p> For your home to show up in these types of searches, <em>your real estate agent needs to use the right
              terms in your online marketing</em>. The effective use of these terms is referred to as search engine
            optimization or SEO.</p>
          <p>The process of identifying and correctly using the right terms is a bit of a science—one that the SEO
            experts at Luxury Presence have mastered. When a potential buyer searches terms that match your home, your
            property will show up in the results and provide opportunities for the buyer to learn more.</p>

        <div class="social-media-text">
          <p>
            If your real estate agent is an influencer on social media, he or she has access to thousands of <em>niche
            buyers</em> who are ready to invest in property. 
          </p>

          <p>To be an influencer, an agent either needs to dedicate a large chunk of their time to social media or they
            need to partner with luxury real estate marketing service providers who can put in the work for them.
            Wouldn’t you rather your agent spent his or her time marketing your property and let an expert handle their
            social media presence?</p>

          <p>At Luxury Presence, <span>our dedicated success team utilizes an agent’s stories and feed posts to help
              them go viral and become an authority in their industry</span>. Once they’ve harnessed the power of
            becoming an influencer, they can use their voice to advocate for your home and sell it more quickly than
            their competitors.</p>
